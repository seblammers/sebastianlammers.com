### About me
I'm a curious person. I love the web. I love dataviz. I love learning about it.
This site is my playground, where I try things. So if you see something that looks off to you or you spot something that you consider inappropriate (like broken layouts or dead links): reach out to me. You can directly reach me via the form below, look at the code on Github or find me on Mastodon.

### About this site
- I made this site with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and lots of &hearts;.
- I can write my blog posts in Markdown, thanks to mdsvex.
- It's deployed via Netlify.
- The fonts are IBM Plex Sans, *IBM Plex Sans Italic* and `IBM Plex Mono`.
- I was inspired my many many great people, read more in my appreciation post over here.
