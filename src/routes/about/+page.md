### About me
I'm a curious person. I love the web. I love dataviz. I love learning about it.
This site is my **playground**, where I try new things. 
So if you see something that jumps out at you: [reach out to me](/contact).

### About this site
- I made this site with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and lots of &hearts;.
- I can write my blog posts in **Markdown**, thanks to [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/).
- It's deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- The fonts are from the [IBM Plex Family](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) 
  - Sans and *Sans Italic* for the main texts 
  - <span class="condensed">Condensed</span> for headings 
  - `Mono` for Code

This website grew over a long period of time and I was inspired my many many great people.
I will write a more detailed post on who influenced me in my design decisions soon<sup>TM</sup>.
