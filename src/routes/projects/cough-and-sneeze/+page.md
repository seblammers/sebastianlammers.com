## Background
Last autumn (September 2022) I made a bet. I said "We're not gonna make it through Winter with 7 continuous days of **no coughing, sneezing or running noses**." And so I started to keep track of the *cold symptoms* in our family of four and every night I would note them down in a form.

After the "common cold season" was over I just kept on tracking our symptoms every night. And today - finally! - I decided to take a look at the data.

To be honest, the pattern I found in the data surprised me.

Of course I won the bet. But it was a close call!

## How to read this chart
The x-axis shows the date (I tracked the symptoms every day) and the y-axis shows the "score". Each person can score between 0 and 3 points, which translates to 0 = "no symptoms" and 3 = "coughing & sneezing & running nose". So the maximum score per day across all 4 persons is 12. We never achieved that maximum score though :)
For each person you see a coloured area that is bigger the more symptoms that person showed. And where the chart is the largest in height, we suffered the most symptoms. Conversely, where the chart is completely flat, we were all completely free of symptoms.

Hover of the legend to highlight a particular person, or hover within the chart to show the values for a given person on that particular day. (I'm not giving names on purpose, feel free to try to figure out who is who in the data.)

I'm surprised that the low points were in December and January, while the months after that showed the highest amount of symptoms.
As you can see, there are two periods during winter, when we *almost* made it to a week without any symptoms... 

Let's zoom into the one period, where we came closest. This period ranges from 2022-12-01 until 2023-01-15 and is depicted in the chart below.

To bad. *That one person (yes, you Person 4!)* ruined the chance of our one-week-streak. But I'm not telling you who that was... I'm innocent, believe me!

Anyway, I won my bet, for sure! And I'm still tracking our symptoms every day. Maybe this data will find another life in a new chart-type once I reach one year of data. Just 3 more months to go!
