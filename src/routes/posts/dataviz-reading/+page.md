I decided to keep some notes on the books that I've read that are directly or indirectly relevant for the field of data visualization. 
It'll be very short and sweet per book, so that it is easy to get an overview.
I also list some books that I plan to read.
Feel free to [suggest](/contact) other interesting books that I might enjoy!

## Recently Read
### Factfulness (Hans Rosling)
- teaches how to ask better questions about any data you encounter
- see also the [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/)
  - free graphics to teach about world development
- see the book on [the publisher's website](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250123824/factfulness)

### Design for Developers (Stephanie Stimac)
- good overview of basic principles of web design
- not strictly related to dataviz, but rather web development in general
- requires the reader to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics
- still useful if you want to built interactive dataviz on the web and are looking to craft more than just the bare charts
- see the book on [the publisher's website](https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers)

### Hands-on Data Visualization (Jack Dougherty & Ilya Ilyankou)
- *very* beginner-friendly
- touches on
  - Excel / Google Sheets basics
  - Datawrapper (basics and advanced)
  - Chart.js and Leaflet.js template solutions
  - tools for geocoding (if you want to create maps)
  - and much more
- read it for free [on their website](https://handsondataviz.org/)
- see the book on [the publisher's website](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-data-visualization/9781492085997/)

### Fundamentals of Data Visualization (Claus Wilke)
- tool-agnostic overview of best-practices in dataviz
- many visual examples (incl. "bad" and "ugly" anti-examples)
- read it for free [on their website](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)
- see the book on [the publisher's website](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781492031079/)

### Interactive Data Visualization for the Web (Scott Murray)
- This was my first foray into the world of [D3](https://d3js.org/) and it was very fun to read. (Seriously, Scott is an amazing writer.)
- Soon after, I learned [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and I'm convinced that the combination of [Svelte & D3 is awesome](https://sebastianlammers.com/projects/awesome-svelte-and-d3).
- I think combining D3 with a JavaScript framework like Svelte is superior to just working with D3 alone.
- If this book would be rewritten with a Svelte + D3 approach, it would be my bible (Scott, do you hear me?).
- But I guess we'll have to wait until [Matthias](https://www.higsch.com/), [Amelia](https://wattenberger.com/) and [Connor](https://www.connorrothschild.com/) write the Svelte + D3 bible.
- Still, this book is special to me, because it's such a good read.
- see the book on [the publisher's website](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/interactive-data-visualization/9781449340223/)

## Wish List
### Building Science Graphics (Jen Christiansen)
- this looks like a great read 
- it comes with an [extensive list of resources](https://www.buildingsciencegraphics.com/more-to-explore) that even goes beyond the contents of the book
- see the book on [the publisher's website](https://www.routledge.com/Building-Science-Graphics-An-illustrated-guide-to-communicating-science/Christiansen/p/book/9781032106748)

### Joyful Infographics (Nigel Holmes)
- I listened to [this podcast episode](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ddjpodcast/episodes/Nigel-Holmes-the-joy-of-data-e1s2sf3) that features the author as a guest and now I really look forward to reading this book
- sounds like a fun and delighting read with lots and lots illustrations
- see the book on [the publisher's website](https://www.routledge.com/Joyful-Infographics-A-Friendly-Human-Approach-to-Data/Holmes/p/book/9781032115580)
