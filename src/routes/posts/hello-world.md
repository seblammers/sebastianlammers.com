Hello and welcome. This is the first time I write something on my very first website!
It's been quite the journey for me and I want to take this moment to do two things:

1. Talk a little about how I arrived here and by doing so
2. Thank all the people that made this possible

## Origins

My background is in Cognitive Neuroscience, which is to say, I get paid to **try** to understand how the human brain works.
Learning how to program in R and Python opened up a new world for me and at some point I tried [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), combining prose and code to produce short reports. **That** was my entry-point to the world of CSS.

I distinctly remember thinking *"Nice, I can adjust the font and colours in this CSS-file!"*. I actually thought it was rather simple. And then the first rabbit-hole opened and I happily jumped in.

Fast forward 1.5 years: I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. **Now** I'm thinking "I have a basic understanding... I can finally really start playing around!"

## Learning CSS from Scratch

Credit where credit is due. The person that made CSS really click for me is [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw). I read through his course [Learn Eleventy From Scratch](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com) and Andy just made everything look so easy and fun. I learned a ton of things there and I love how Andy explains things!
